# solar-power-prediction
Solar energy generation relies heavily on photovoltaic (PV) systems, but predicting their power output can be challenging due to the intermittent and volatile nature of solar power, primarily influenced by weather conditions. To address this, we analyze a dataset containing 4,213 rows and 21 columns, where 20 are independent variables, and the dependent variable is `generated_power_kw`. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, zenith angle, azimuth, angle of incidence, and shortwave radiation, among others. Since solar energy production is directly impacted by environmental factors, it is not always a stable or consistent source of electricity. By leveraging machine learning (ML) and data processing (DP) techniques, we have developed a predictive model to estimate solar power generation with improved accuracy.
